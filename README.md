ARTIFACTS


The artifacts I’ve chosen for this portfolio are a collection of my most recent completed projects, all these artifacts come from the last 6-8 months. Both of my first two artifacts are written in python as I feel it’s my most comfortable language. Even though I have experience with many of languages, including but not limited to, Java, C, HTML, Assembly, SQL. Artifacts three and four are visual studio projects including both python and C++.  


Artifact 1 is the code for a weather station using a Raspberry pi system with a Grove module. It takes temperature, humidity and light readings ever 30 minutes. If the light threshold is met it activates LED lights and pushes the reading to a json file. That json fil is then used by a web client to publish the weather readings to a webpage. 



Artifact 2 is my work with a MongoDB database. There’s a test file there meant to run the CRUD operation on a database using a test value. Then there’s the actual CRUD file where you can manipulate the database from a text menu. The third file is a search file meant to be used with a stock market database we were given for the class.



Artifact 3 and 4 are very similar projects. Both built for the same class. I included them both to show how I understand the importance of building modular code. I used a large amount of artifact 3 to make artifact 4. 

Artifact 3 is a simple math program that displays a multiplication table based on a user input and then can double that number. 

Artifact 4 is a sales program that takes it’s input from a txt file, formats it and then can show a complete sales list, the amount of a specific item sold, or display a visual histogram of the days sales.
